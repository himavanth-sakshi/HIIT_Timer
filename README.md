# HIIT_Timer

While I am doing HIIT exercise I always have trouble with getting a proper timer.
So, I built one!

A simple and customizable **High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)** timer built using Python and Tkinter. 
The app allows you to configure work and rest durations, number of rounds, and provides audio alerts during the workout.

## Features

- **Set custom work and rest durations**
- **Configure the number of rounds**
- üîä **Audio cues** for:
  - Start of each work session
  - Last 3 seconds of each phase
  - Every second from 12 to 1 in the final 12 seconds of work and rest duration- DO IT!!
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Pause and Resume** the timer
- ‚èπÔ∏è **Stop** the workout anytime
- ü™ü **Responsive window layout** (resizes with the window)

## Requirements

- Python 3.10
- `playsound` module for audio playback
